    "## Coordinate Transforms in ROS\n",
    "As in the lecture, coordinate frame transformations are fundamental to robotics. For articulated robot arms, you can deduce the forward and inverse kinematics to compute gripper poses as a function of joint angles or vice-versa. The latter is possible by multiplying transformations describing the current state of the robot. Sensor data, e.g. from cameras, can be merged into the robot's coordinate frame, and this data must be interpreted in terms of alternative frames (e.g. world frame or robot frame) to allow a robot to perceive and act within the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "ROS provides a useful package for handling, maintaining and updating these transformations. This package is [tf](http://wiki.ros.org/tf) and offers command-line tools for inspecting transformations of a robot. TF also provides APIs in ROS's supported programming languages to manipulate and plan movements with robots. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find out how to use TF, let's start Gazebo and bring up a robot (Baxter) by typing in the terminal (you can find a terminal shortcut in the Desktop):\n",

    "To find more about `rostopic`, [go here!](http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic). You will find out that `rostopic` is a very neat tool for inspecting and getting message types of available topics within a ROS system. The `tf` topic uses messages of type [tf2_msgs/TFMessage](http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/tf2_msgs/html/msg/TFMessage.html) which consists of a variable-length array of a [stamped transform](http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html) message. ROS does not employ the homogenous 4-by-4 matrix representation covered in the lecture but uses a 3-D vector (equivalent to the fourth column of a 4-by-4 transform for denoting translations) and a [quaternion](http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/algebra/realNormedAlgebra/quaternions/). The quaternion representation is an alternative to homogenous matrices, have powerful mathematical properties, and avoid several problems while using homogeneous transformations and Euler angles. The quaternion's data structure is more efficient to carry pose information than the homogenous matrix representation. That is, homogenous transformations need 12 floating-point numbers (16 numbers but the last row is always a row vector equal to 0 and the 4th entry equal to 1) as opposed to 7 floating-point numbers when using quaternions. Transform messages also have timestamps, and they explicitly name the child frame and the parent frame (as text strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "In ROS, orientations are commonly expressed as unit quaternions. **However, you do not need to worry about quaternions that much because TF provides functions to transform quaternions into Euler angles and even homogenous transformations!** At this point, it is sufficient to know that there is a correspondence between quaternions and rotation matrices (ROS functions to perform such conversions will be introduced later) and that there are corresponding mathematical operations for coordinate transformations with quaternions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be (and typically are) many publishers to the tf topic. Each publisher expresses a transforming relationship, describing a named child frame with respect to a named parent frame - more about this in the following sections. You can now examine the output of the `tf` topic with:"

    "The above command shows all available transformations for Baxter. As stated above, each message has a child and parent frame, which defines the transformation between the given link names. Each link name is a reference frame within the robot.

In this case, `joint_states` is part of the `robot` namespace (if you run `rostopic list`, you will find out that topics about Baxter are declared using the `robot` namespace). It is recommended to use namespaces in ROS to follow good software engineering practices, and it is convenient when the complexity of the ROS system increases.\n",

These values are needed to compute transformations for link poses for all links defined in Baxter. For instance, the transformation pf Baxter's `head` frame with respect to the `base` frame cannot be computed without knowing the value of the `head_pan` angular position (see list above). To find out the transformation from `base` to `head`, run in a terminal:\n",

    "A parent can have multiple children, but a child must have a unique parent, thus generating a hierarchical tree of geometric relationships with respect to this parent frame. In ROS, you can create a `tf_listener` which is typically started as an independent thread. This thread subscribes to the `tf` topic and assembles a kinematic tree from individual parent-child transform messages. Since the `tf_listener` incorporates all transformations, it can address specific queries, such as *where is Baxter's right-hand finger frame relative to Baxter's head?”* The reply to this query is a transform message that can be used to reconcile different frames. As long as a complete tree connecting frames is published, the transform listener can be used to transform all available kinematic, sensor, etc. data into a common reference frame, thus allowing to display the data from multiple sources in a common frame.\n",
